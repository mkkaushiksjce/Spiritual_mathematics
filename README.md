## 1. Mathematical Proof of God

### God doesn't exist, you should be a fool trying to prove the existence of GOD.

May be but in mathematics and physics we first discover the phenomenon and then we reason out how it works, similarly we know the phenomenon called GOD but we need to prove him.

### Why maths are you kidding ??? 

Sir Issac newton depicted that nature always follow mathematics. Even if GOD is supernatural, still he is half natural and half super, so mathematics should be able to give the proof the GOD, may be indirectly. 

### Hell yeah, then lets get's started. Here goes the proof.

We are using mathematical reasoning principles, to use the spiritual description of god presented by many sacred texts and using number theory we are interpreting those results.
